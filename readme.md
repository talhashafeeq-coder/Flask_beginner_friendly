# Beginner friendly Project with help of Python and Javascript
## Through the backend, we collect various data from the admin, which is stored in the MySQL database. This data is then displayed on the front end (React). The data is collected from the admin in a hierarchical manner: first the parent, followed by its child, and then its sub-child. This hierarchical data is later displayed on the front end. Additionally, there is a separate section for exams. In the exam section, we gather various questions related to the selected language, display them to the user, conduct their test, and then show the test results. 

##### The Docker image command will be added to the system very soon.

## Thank you ðŸ’™
